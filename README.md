# Generation of synthetic genomics datasets

This repository contains the analysis steps associated with the paper "Semantically Rich Local Dataset Generation for Explainable AI in Genomics", which introduces a new method for generating local synthetic datasets to study RNA splicing regulation.

All datasets generated for this study are available on Zenodo. To reproduce the figures presented in the paper, simply download these datasets and run the `plots.ipynb` notebook. It is important to note that our evolutionary searches were conducted on a specific GPU model (ADD GPU MODEL) within a local server environment. Given this hardware specificity and the time constraint of 10 minutes per experiment, exact replication of results may vary when using different hardware setups.
